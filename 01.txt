CISCO IN AN HOUR IV

Network Layer
  Transmission of data btwn 2 sep networks (eg school nw <-> digital ocean nw)
  I N T E R N E T
  Connectionless: unconcerned whether or not data was sent successfully
  addressing, routing, packet forwarding

  Internet Protocal (IP) addresses
    IPv4: 4 byte address [0-255].[0-255].[0-255].[0-255]
                          octet (8 bit)
    routing is made easier by having ip addresses distributed in blocks

CISCO IN AN HOUR V

an ip doesn't have to be identical throughout run
packets will be forwarded by network equipments
  $ traceroute google.com
  : all of devices MY data has to go through to reach google (network host)
  : each step is called a "hop"

Network layer (cont.)
  data is broken into packets(IPv4)
  <header info><packet length><fragment info><time-to-live><protocol><header checksum><src><dest><...><data>
		       		20 - 65,535B
  h.i.: packet type (v4/6), header length..
  fragment info: full payloads may be broken up; contains total # pf fragments, which fragment
  time-to-live: maximum hops before packet DEATH
    ->identical to how traceroute works: incrementing t2l
  protocol: TCP/UDP/...
  <...>: optional info
  src, dest: 4 bytes each, IPv4 addresses

the problem with IPv4: running out of ip address
IPv6
  address space: 2^32 -> 2^128
  8 groups of 4 hexadecimal digits
    87ab : 301c : 73ab : 8731...
      this is how you write it, not how it is rep in computer

    leading 0s are ignored
    0000 replaced with ::, but only once in an address

  IPv4 address can be represented with 5 0-groups, 1 f-group(96 bits) followed by original v4 address (32 bits)
       :: ffff : 149.89.150.100
  some incompatibility exist: cannot be interchanged
  jumbograms: increase MTU to ~4.3 billion (2^32)
