C strings
  Strings are chr arrays that end with a null character:
  	  '' or 0 or '\0'
	  terminating null chr is convention
	  	      things after t.n. not displayed
	  string func will not work correctly without it
  literal string uses "", immutable str is created and stored in mem.
  	  automatically null terminated

  chr should be in single quote
      chr is an int type. 65 = 'A'
      
  sizeof(array) = assigned/allocated number

declaration
	char s[256];
	     allocates 256 bytes, nothing default
	     have to set t.n. manually

	char s[256] = "mangoes";
	     256 bytes, create immutable string mangoes
	     then copies into s
	     and include t.n.
	     	 if s[n] n<yourstring len, might muddle w/ other variables.
		 dangerous!

	char s[] = "durians";
	     allocate 8 (7+1 t.n.) bytes

	char *s = "grapes";
	     pointer points to generate immutable string mem. cannot modify
